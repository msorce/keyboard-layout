# keyboard-layout
This is my programming layout for my anne pro 2 


## Requirements

### Download obinskit
https://annepro2.com/pages/download

### Remap caps to escape
Anne pro 2 magic fn can only be mapped to caps lock, however, I like to map caps lock to escape (old vim habits). 
Remapping caps using Obinskit will get rid of magic fn functionality
Remapping must be done at an operating system level

#### Macos 
settings > modifier keys > remap caps to escape (Magic fn still works!ðŸŽ‰)
  
#### Windows

Official Microsoft tool for remapping keys: https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/
installation guide: https://www.windowsdigitals.com/how-to-remap-keyboard-keys-in-windows-11/

open powertoys > keyboard manager > remap key (Magic fn still works!ðŸŽ‰)

### Change meta key for mac

settings > modifier keys > remap option => command & command => option
